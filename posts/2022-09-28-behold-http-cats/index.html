(If you're not a keen reader of this blog...where have you been?! ;-) )</p><p>I'm fortunate to be part of the native app development teams at SkyBet. We're always looking to make our apps better and innovate in the latest technologies. As a leader I think it's important to "practice what you preach" and be at least familiar with the ecosystem in which you play a (small) part.</p><p>It's been a while since I've written any production code (they'll be plenty of people who are happy about this...) but I do like to practice every now and again. Learning a new language &amp; framework seemed like a good excuse.</p><p>Those who know me will be aware that I'm an Android user. You might be wondering why this wasn't Jetpack Compose... watch this space. :-)</p><h2>How?</h2><ul><li>Get access to a Mac® laptop (seems obvious, but I'm fortunate to have this - I'm aware it's a high barrier to entry. You can learn and compile Swift® online here http://online.swiftplayground.run/ without a Mac)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Learnt SwiftUI - following the Apple® tutorials. (https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Thought up a simple idea for an app; it helped that the images had an API of sorts to download them (credit to Fili Wiese for putting these sites together)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Developed the app (complete with <em>some</em> Unit and UI tests - you can see them for yourself in the code; I need to add more.)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Became a fully fledged Apple developer (https://developer.apple.com/)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>I was already familiar with the App Stores processes, but I still had to fill out my own Privacy Policy and generate App Store assets (this is hard work for a non-designer!).<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Submitted to Apple after frequent Testflight releases<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Dealt with 3 app review rejections (I'd forgotten to include the <em>required</em> capabilities section https://developer.apple.com/support/required-device-capabilities/) (<code>&lt;rant&gt;</code>why, Apple, if it's a required element, don't you prompt before wasting your review team's time? Or prevent installation of the app on a simulator? <code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code>)</li></ul><h2>What have I learnt?</h2><p>Lots!</p><ul><li>Swift (a small fraction I'm sure)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>SwiftUI (scratched the surface!)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Xcode Cloud (this is an amazing <em>free</em> provision from Apple!)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Bitrise (although I didn't use it for the majority of the builds)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Refamiliarised myself with Github (especially around tracking a project)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>The Apple ecosystem - resources, communities<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Dealing with frustration and set back (and keeping on)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>More about using Xcode (a tiny proportion of it - I'm still very much a beginner)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Design (<em>I'm definitely not a designer</em>)<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Making connections with people<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Building an app is fun!<ul></ul></li></ul><ul><li>... &amp; probably more that I've already forgotten</li></ul><h2>Where next?</h2><p>The source code is open source and available to peruse at your leisure at https://github.com/adrenalinehit/CatCodes.</p><p>There are many ways to improve and further develop the app. Take a look at the issues list here: https://github.com/adrenalinehit/CatCodes/issues.</p><p>Get in touch if you'd like to get involed. I will review all PRs submitted. (https://github.com/adrenalinehit/CatCodes/pull/30 for example)</p><p>I definitely need an artist to create some art work for this app - I'm <em>not</em> a designer or artist.
